# Azure AI Foundry Infrastructure Setup

It contains all the necessary modules and code to deploy a private networking enabled AI Foundry environment.

## Overview

This configuration is suited for:

- **Enterprise/regulated workloads** that require private networking and enhanced security controls
- **Organizations with existing Azure services** that need to integrate AI Foundry with their current Cosmos DB, Storage, and AI Search resources
- **Teams with strict network security requirements** that mandate subnet injection and private endpoint connectivity
- **Environments that need both data sovereignty and network isolation** with RBAC-based access controls

## Key Features

- **🔒 Private networking**: AI Foundry and agents are injected into your existing VNet subnets for enhanced security
- **🌍 Existing resource integration**: Uses your existing Cosmos DB, Storage, and AI Search resources for complete control
- **🛡️ Enhanced security**: Private endpoints and subnet injection eliminate public internet exposure
- **📊 Observability**: Log Analytics and Application Insights out of the box
- **📈 Enterprise-ready**: Built for regulated workloads with strict security and compliance requirements

## Prerequisites

  - **Network Contributor**: Needed over the resource group and VNet to create private endpoint resources
  - **Azure AI Account Owner**: Needed to create a cognitive services account and project
  - **Owner or Role Based Access Administrator**: Needed to assign RBAC to the existing resources (Cosmos DB, Azure AI Search, Storage)
  - **Azure AI User**: Needed to create and edit agents
  - **Cognitive Services OpenAI Contributor**: Needed to write OpenAI responses API

### 4. Register Resource Providers

```shell
az provider register --namespace 'Microsoft.App'

```

### 5. Tools Requirements

- Sufficient quota for all resources in your target Azure region
- Azure CLI installed and configured on your local workstation or deployment pipeline server

## Private Networking Configuration

This configuration enables private networking by default with:

- **Subnet injection**: Both AI Foundry service and Agents are injected into your specified subnets
- **Public access disabled**: All communication flows through your private network
- **Private endpoints**: Secure connectivity to Azure services within your VNet

Ensure your existing Cosmos DB, Storage, and AI Search services are configured appropriately for private access if needed.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Subnet configuration errors**

- Verify that `agents_subnet_id` and `foundry_subnet_id` are valid subnet resource IDs
- Ensure subnets exist in your VNet and have proper network policies configured

**Existing resource errors**

- Confirm resource names and resource group IDs are correct
- Ensure the project identity has required RBAC on existing resources
- Verify all existing resources are in the same Azure region

**Private networking issues**

- Check that existing resources are accessible from specified subnets
- Review network security group rules and route tables
- Ensure private DNS configuration is correct

**Quota/region issues**

- Check model availability in your target region
- Verify service quotas for all required resources

**Provider registration**

- Validate all required providers are registered
- Run `terraform validate` to check configuration

### Validation Commands

```shell
# Validate Terraform configuration
terraform validate

# Check Azure CLI context
az account show

# Verify resource providers
az provider list --query "[?registrationState=='Registered'].namespace" -o table
```

## Cost Considerations

This configuration provisions:

- Azure AI Foundry Account and Project
- Log Analytics Workspace (30-day retention)
- Application Insights
- Model deployments

Review SKUs and retention settings to optimize costs. The configuration uses existing Cosmos DB, Storage, and AI Search resources, so additional costs for those services depend on your existing configuration.

## Security Considerations

- Private networking eliminates public internet exposure
- Role assignments follow principle of least privilege
- All communication flows through your controlled network boundaries
- Monitor access through Application Insights and Log Analytics
